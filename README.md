Unify Like You Pattern Match in Scala!
======================================

Even wished you can do term unification like you do pattern matching in Scala? This lightweight library defines a set of combinators to implement control statements that resemble Scala's pattern matching. Alternatively, it also includes a unification 'pattern extractor' that exploits Scala's extensible pattern matching framework. So, now you can unify like you pattern match in Scala!

* This implementation was made possible by an JSREP grant (JSREP 4-003-2-001, Effective Distributed 
Programming via Join Patterns with Guards, Propagation and More) from the Qatar National Research Fund 
(a member of the Qatar Foundation).

Current version supports first-order term unification.
